# Temperature Alert Agent

This project is a Temperature Alert Agent that uses the uAgent library to connect to a free weather API and fetch real-time temperatures for a specified location. Users can set their preferred temperature range and location, and the agent will send an alert/notification when the current temperature in their chosen location goes below the minimum or above the maximum threshold they've set.
